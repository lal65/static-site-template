The Penn State World Campus design system was developed with accessibility in mind, ensuring that all users, regardless of any disabilities, can easily navigate and interact with the website. The design system incorporates the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) AA criteria, which provides a higher level of accessibility than the basic Level A standards. By adhering to the WCAG AA guidelines, the World Campus design system ensures that users with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive disabilities can access and engage with the online content effectively.

One way in which the World Campus design system meets WCAG AA standards is through its use of clear and consistent navigation. The system utilizes descriptive labels for links and buttons, making it easier for users using screen readers or other assistive technologies to understand the purpose of each element. Additionally, the system includes skip navigation links that allow users to bypass repetitive content and go directly to the main content of the page, improving efficiency for all users.

Another way in which the World Campus design system meets WCAG AA criteria is through its use of color contrast. The system ensures that text and interactive elements have sufficient contrast with background colors, making it easier for users with visual impairments to read and interact with the content. By following the recommended color contrast ratios outlined in the WCAG AA guidelines, the World Campus design system provides a more inclusive experience for all users.

In conclusion, the Penn State World Campus design system demonstrates a strong commitment to accessibility by incorporating WCAG AA standards into its design and development process. By focusing on clear navigation, color contrast, and alternative text for images, the system provides an inclusive online experience for all users, regardless of their abilities. Through its dedication to accessibility, the World Campus design system sets a high standard for other online platforms to follow in creating a more accessible web for everyone.
